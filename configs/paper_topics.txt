 1. New theoretical analysis of CLIP-style dirscrimative vision-language models, such as the representation space of CLIP, the robustness of CLIP.
    - Relevant: papers that provide new theoretical insights into the representation space of CLIP, the robustness of CLIP, or other aspects of CLIP-style models.
    - Not relevant: papers that are about applications of CLIP-style models to specific domains, or papers that are about the performance of CLIP-style models on specific benchmarks.
 2. New novel analysis of GPT4V-style generative vision-language models, such as the their current inherent limitations and how to make their better.
    - Relevant: papers that provide new insights into the limitations of GPT4V-style models, or that propose new methods to improve them.
    - Not relevant: papers that are about applications of GPT4V-style models to specific domains, or papers that are about the performance of GPT4V-style models on specific benchmarks.
 3. Studies 'scaling laws' in the context of neural networks, especially vision-language models. Scaling laws refer to the very clear power-law relationship between the size or computational power used to train a model and the performance of that model.
    - Relevant: theoretical or conceptual explanation behind scaling laws for language models.
    - Not relevant: papers that have experiments at different model scales (but do not explicitly fit a scaling law) or papers that mention scaling laws, but the scaling laws are not the central subject of the paper

 In suggesting papers to your friend, remember that he enjoys papers on in-depth and insightful analysis of multi-modal machine learning, including CLIP-style dirscrimative models and GPT4V-style generative models.
 Your friend also likes learning about surprising empirical results in multi-modal learning.
 He does not want to read papers that are about primarily applications of methods to specific domains.
